# Go Web3 App for Ethereum: An Educational Project

This project serves as a practical guide for developers interested in learning how to use the Go programming language 
to interact with the Ethereum network. Through a series of examples and tools, this project demonstrates key concepts 
and workflows, making it easier to understand and implement blockchain-based applications.

## Intended Audiance

Any blockchain enthusiast, a student, or an experienced developer looking to explore the Ethereum 
ecosystem with Go, this educational project provides a foundation for creating decentralized Applications (dApps) 
and interacting with Ethereum smart contracts.

## Scope of the Project

The project focuses on building foundational tools and applications using Go. The key deliverables include:

1. **Web3 Application**: A simple example of how a hypothetical user can send transactions to the Ethereum network and interact with deployed smart contracts.
2. **Wallet**: Functionality to manage cryptographic keys, allowing users to securely store and access their Ethereum addresses.
3. **Smart Contract Deployment**: Tools to deploy smart contracts onto the Ethereum network directly from a Go application.
4. **Blockchain Viewer**: A minimalistic blockchain explorer to retrieve and display Ethereum blockchain data.

These features are designed to highlight essential workflows and integration patterns between Go and Ethereum.
